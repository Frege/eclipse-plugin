What is fregIDE?
================

*fregIDE* is an Eclipse plugin that supports the [frege programming language](https://github.com/Frege/).

Currently, we do not have an update site for the ready-to-go plugin. We're working on this.
You can [download](http://code.google.com/p/frege/downloads/list) a zip-archive and install from that.
Please follow the  [tutorial](https://github.com/Frege/eclipse-plugin/wiki/) after downloading.

If you want to help develop the frege IDE, follow the steps below. 
This assumes that one already has installed the IMP plugin's as described in the [tutorial](https://github.com/Frege/eclipse-plugin/wiki/).

  1. [Download](http://code.google.com/p/frege/downloads/list) frege compiler/library jar. 
  2. Clone the eclipse-plugin repository.
  3. Copy the compiler jar to `eclipse-plugin/lib/fregec.jar`.
  4. Fire up eclipse and import repository `eclipse-plugin` as project from filesystem.
  5. Build the project (don't be scared by some Java warnings)
  6. Write code to improve the *fregIDE*, fix bugs, add features ....
  7. You can now make a *Run Configuration* to run the project as eclipse application. Be sure the VM arguments include `-XX:MaxPermSize=256m -XX:+TieredCompilation -Xms40m -Xss4m -Xmx768m`.
  8. Apply and Run.
  9. Once this works, you can replace the fregec.jar and rebuild `eclipse-plugin` whenever the need arises.

How does it look like?
