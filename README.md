What is fregIDE?
================

*fregIDE* is an Eclipse plugin that supports the [frege programming language](https://github.com/Frege/).

Unfortunately, it looks like the IMP technology, whereupon fregIDE is built, is no longer supported by Eclipse. 
Since the download site for the IMP plugin seems to be no longer existing, 
it is unclear at the moment if and how new users can install. 
It looks like the [IMP runtime](https://github.com/impulse-org/imp.runtime) is now hosted on GitHub, 
we'll need to find a way to bundle and install it.

*Update (Mar 2)* I asked the people there if it would be possible to make a new update site for IMP, and they said it was possible. So please stay tuned, maybe 1 week or two and we'll have it going again.

*Update (Mar 8)* Meanwhile, Nicolas Noullet has found out how to install the IMP plugin without update site and has posted detailed instructions in the [discussion group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/frege-programming-language). Merci bien, Nicolas! Despite this, we're still looking for an easier solution.

If you had installed fregIDE earlier, you can upgrade from the 
[upgrade site](http://www.frege-lang.org/fregide/), as you should have all necessary prerequisites already.


How does it look like?
