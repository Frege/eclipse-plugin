What is fregIDE?
================

*fregIDE* is an Eclipse plugin that supports the [frege programming language](https://github.com/Frege/).

You can install or upgrade *fregIDE* from the 
installation/upgrade site at http://www.frege-lang.org/fregide/.

**UPDATE** It has come to my attention that the link above seems to have problems at times, like 

  - eclipse complains it is not an update site
  - the download goes very slow and even times out (see also [Issue#10](https://github.com/Frege/eclipse-plugin/issues/10))

If you experience the same, try this [alternative URL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Frege/frege.github.com/master/fregide).

Please also read [the tutorial](https://github.com/Frege/eclipse-plugin/wiki/fregIDE-Tutorial) that describes the installation in detail.


How does it look like?
